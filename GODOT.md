# What is Godot?

Godot is a fully free and open source (FOSS) game engine capable of producing high quality 2D and 3D games. You can see some examples [here.](https://godotengine.org/showcase/) Since it's FOSS, you can download and use it for free whenever you want. You can even modify the engine itself if you want. You don't need to make any accounts or purchases. 

# Which programming languages does it support?

Godot primarily supports [two different programming languages.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_languages.html) GDScript and C#. These are fully compatible and can [both be used together](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/cross_language_scripting.html) in the same project. This situation allows everyone to select whichever language most appeals to them.

GDScript is Godots own scripting language - if you were around for UnityScript, it's a lot like that. It's highly integrated with the engine, which includes a built-in editor with advanced debugging features.

C# has taken the game dev world by storm. It is the language of choice for modern Unity and many other engines. Both languages are great options.

# Where do I get it?

You can download Godot [here.](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) Be sure to select the .NET version - it should read "x86_64 - C# support" under the download button. Flathub users can run `flatpak install GodotSharp` to install the flatpak (app/org.godotengine.GodotSharp/x86_64/stable)

# How do I get started?

Before you can work on the project with us, you need to clone the Git repository! See [GIT.md](https://github.com/zorafly/TAGameOff2025/blob/main/GIT.md) if you don't know how.

Once you have cloned your fork, you are ready to launch Godot and click **import**, right next to "create" at the top left. Navigate to where you cloned your repository, and select the "project.godot" file inside the "godot-project" folder. After hitting "import", the editor should launch and you will be good to go!
