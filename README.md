# TAGameOff2025
TransAdvice.org community project for itch.io's "Game Off 2025" Game Jam

# What is a game jam?

A game jam is a game development contest. Teams compete to develop the best game in the same, limited amount of time. For Game Off, we get one month - from November 1st, to December 1st. To ensure fairness, the theme of the contest isn't announced until it starts. That's on Saturday, November 1, 2025 at 13:37 Pacific!

# I can't code

All skill levels are welcome! **You don't need to know how to code**, or even be interested in coding. Every game needs artists, designers, storytellers, and testers! Reach out to Zora at TA if you're interested in participating.

# Technical details

To ensure a smooth start, I've made a few early decisions for us. Our project will be [MIT licensed](https://opensource.org/license/MIT)\*, and we will use the [Godot Game Engine.](https://godotengine.org/)

Godot is a fully free and open source (FOSS) game engine capable of producing high quality 2D and 3D games. You can see some examples [here.](https://godotengine.org/showcase/) Since it's FOSS, you can download and use it for free whenever you want. You can even modify the engine itself if you want. You don't need to make any accounts or purchases. 

Godot primarily supports [two different programming languages.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_languages.html) GDScript and C#. These are fully compatible and can both be used together in the same project. This situation allows everyone to select whichever language most appeals to them.

GDScript is Godots own scripting language - if you were around for UnityScript, it's a lot like that. It's highly integrated with the engine, which includes a built-in editor with advanced debugging features.

C# has taken the game dev world by storm. It is the language of choice for Unity and many other engines. Both languages are great options.

\**This only applies to code - If you'd like to contribute art assets, you can select whichever Creative Commons license you like; I'm aware there is a big culture difference*
