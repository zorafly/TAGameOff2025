# TAGameOff2025
TransAdvice.org community project for itch.io's "Game Off 2025" Game Jam

# What is a game jam?

A game jam is a game development contest. Teams compete to develop the best game in the same, limited amount of time. For Game Off, we get one month - from November 1st, to December 1st. To ensure fairness, the theme of the contest isn't announced until it starts. That's on Saturday, November 1, 2025 at 13:37 Pacific!

# I can't code

All skill levels are welcome! **You don't need to know how to code**, or even be interested in coding. Every game needs artists, designers, storytellers, and testers! Reach out to Zora at TA if you're interested in participating.

# Technical details

To ensure a smooth start, I've made a few early decisions for us. Our project will be [MIT licensed](https://opensource.org/license/MIT)\*, and we will use the [Godot Game Engine.](https://godotengine.org/) See [GODOT.md](https://github.com/zorafly/TAGameOff2025/blob/main/GODOT.md) for more information.

\**This only applies to code - If you'd like to contribute art assets, you can select whichever Creative Commons license you like; I'm aware there is a big culture difference*
