TA is participating in Game Off 2025! The theme will be announced as the competition begins at Saturday, November 1, 2025 at 13:37! 

Everyone is welcome to participate! Our project will be MIT licensed. We will use the [Godot Game Engine.](https://godotengine.org/) 

All skill levels are welcome! **You don't need to know how to code**, or even be interested in coding. Every game needs artists, designers, storytellers, and testers! Reach out to Zora at TA if you're interested in participating.
